# About
ScholarFest was put together to provide awareness to financial resources available to engineering undergraduates at the University of Michigan. Whether it be discussing financial wellness (how to conduct safe financial practices) or dealing with financial stress in/out of college, there are many topics that can be valuable for students to be able to explore before graduation.
